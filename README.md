# Inverse Classification with Generative Adversarial Networks

This is the accompanying repository for a project described in my blog post TODO:link.

The code for the conditional GAN is a slight adaption of https://github.com/malzantot/Pytorch-conditional-GANs implementation. All credit for the GAN part belongs to him, I merely updated some deprecated functions. 

All other things have been added by me. If you have any questions or comments just contact me at `marius.hobbhahn [at] gmail [dot] com`. 

# Running the code

- Training a network can be done with the conditional_dcgan.py file
- Vizualizing the quality of the generated images can be done via the show_results.py file
- Running the Inverse Classification with the different experiments can be done via the test_IC.py file
